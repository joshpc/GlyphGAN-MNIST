# GlyphGAN-MNIST

Experiments with machine learning. This particular project implements the [GlyphGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12502v1) paper, but using a different dataset (MNIST instead of their selected fonts.)

## Setup

_Disclaimer: Mileage may vary. This was an afterthought! Sorry._

- Requires Python 3, Jupyter
- Requires: `pytorch`, `imageio`, `torchvision`, `matplotlib`.

## Running / Training

- Run `jupyter notebook`, open `GlyphGAN`
- Run through all blocks until training. Optionally run training. Run visualization.
- No real practical use yet, just experimenting.

## Acknowledgements / Inspiration

- Many code snippets are taken from the CS231N assignments: http://cs231n.github.io/
